        <p>
        Hello, my name is Connor Harrington, I am 18 years old and am a freshman at New England 
        Institute of Technology.  I am studying Cyber Security and Newtork Engineering in hopes to
        have a successful career working with computers.  I enjoy creating servers for video games
        I play such as Minecraft and Ark: Survival Evolved.  Other than making game servers, I enjoy
        researching current events, driving my car, and spending time with my family, friends and pets.
        I'm looking forward to working hard in my current and future classes to gain a wealth of knowledge
        in the career path I've chosen.
        </p>
