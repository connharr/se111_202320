                <p><em>The Dark Knight</em>, a DC Comics movie directed by Chrisotpher Nolan, is a revolutionary movie that brings out the darker, more serious nature of the DC Universe.  It is clear from the beginning that the Joker poses a real threat for Batman and his allies in Gotham City by his representation from actor Heath Ledger, who encapsulated Joker's sadistic yet playful spirit through his interactions with the other characters in the movie.  All the way through <em>The Dark Knight</em>, I was on the edge of my seat, whether it be because of a high speed chase scene, or just simple near death explosions.  The screeenwriting also flowed well as there were no scenes that felt like filler material or out of place.</p>

                <h3><em>The Dark Knight</em> Trivia</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Two-Face's disfigurement was created through computer graphics rather than prosthetic make-up, as writer, producer, and director Christopher Nolan felt that, no matter how good the make-up was, it is still inherently adding something onto an actor's face, when Two-Face's appearance requires part of his face to be burned away.</li>
                    <li>In preparation for his role as the Joker, Heath Ledger hid away in a motel room for about six weeks. During this extended stay of seclusion, Ledger delved deep into the psychology of the character. He devoted himself to developing the Joker's every tic, namely the voice and that sadistic-sounding laugh (for the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker). Ledger's interpretation of the Joker's appearance was primarily based on the chaotic, disheveled look of punk rocker Sid Vicious combined with the psychotic mannerisms of Malcolm McDowell's character, Alex De Large, from A Clockwork Orange (1971). </li>
                    <li>This was the first comic book movie to reach the $1 billion mark worldwide.</li>
                </ul>
